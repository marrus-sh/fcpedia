# things to do which aren’t pages:
#
# • add support for page authors
#
# • fix the header on small screens
#
#    • more things should be allowed to wrap than currently are!
#
# • generally revise the stylesheet; it hasn’t been meaningfully
#   touched in years
#
# • add a simple search for pages by title—see pages.json
